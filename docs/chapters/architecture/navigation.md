# Navigation

In order to explain the navigation of the app, we have to differientiate between the generic `Navigation Service` and the app views structure defined as Shells, and how the general navigation is applied in the app.

- [Navigation Service section](navigation-service.md): We will review here how the generic *Navigation Service* is defined to be re-used in case we need to develop another version of the app for diffrent platforms.
- [App Shell structure and Navigation section](navigation-app.md): We will define the common structure of all the views in the app, and how the navigation in managed in our UWP app.
